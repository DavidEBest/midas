<p>Hello <% if (given_name) { %><%- given_name %><% } %>,</p>

<p>The alternate phase of the applicant review process has started. Itâ€™s time to review the applicants and choose your interns.
  During the alternate phase, you have <span style="font-weight:bold">two weeks</span> to select your alternate interns. 
  You can also continue to select primary interns if you find a better match or need to fill another spot. Once the alternate phase closes, you will no longer be able to select interns.</p>
