<p>Hello <% if (given_name) { %><%- given_name %><% } %>,</p>

<p>The application review process, for the U.S. Department of State Student Internship Program (Unpaid), 
  has ended and the <strong>cycle is closed.</strong> You can no longer select interns or make changes to your applicant review board.
  Weâ€™ve archived all of the application review boards, but you can easily <a href="<%- archivelink %>">access the archived boards here.</a></p>
<p style="color:rgb(46, 116, 181);">
  What happens next?
</P>
<p>Now that the review process has ended and the cycle is closed, we will:</p>
<ol>  
  <li>Email each applicant selected for either a primary or alternate intern position with next steps.</li>
  <li>Email all applicants who were not selected.</li>
</ol>
